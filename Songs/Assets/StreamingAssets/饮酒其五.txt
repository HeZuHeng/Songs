饮酒（其五）
Drinking Wine 5
结庐在人境，而无车马喧。
In people’s haunt I built my cot;
Of wheel’s and hoof’s noise I hear not.
问君何能尔？心远地自偏。
How can it leave on me no trace?
Secluded heart makes secluded place.
采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。
I pick fence-side asters at will;
Carefree I see the southern hill.
山气日夕佳，飞鸟相与还。
The mountain air’s fresh day and night;
Together birds go home in flight.
此中有真意，欲辨已忘言。
What revelation at this view?
Words fail me if I try to tell you.
