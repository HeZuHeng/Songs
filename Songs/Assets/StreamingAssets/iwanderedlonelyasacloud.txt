I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud
	--William Wordsworth
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Besides the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
 
The waves beside them danced; but they
Outdid the sparking waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed – and gazed – but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

我孤独地漫游，像一朵云
在山丘和谷地上飘荡，
忽然间我看见一群
金色的水仙花迎春开放，
在树荫下，在湖水边，
迎着微风起舞翩翩。
 
连绵不绝，如繁星灿烂，
在银河里闪闪发光，
它们沿着河湾的边缘
延伸成无穷无尽的一行；
我一眼看见了一万朵，
在欢舞之中起伏颠簸。
 
鳞鳞波光也在跳着舞，
水仙的欢欣却胜过水波；
与这样快活的伴侣为伍，
诗人怎能不欢欣快乐！
我久久凝望，却想象不到
这奇景赋予我多少财宝，——
 
每当我躺在床上不眠，
或心神空茫，或默默沉思，
它们常在心灵中闪现，
那是孤独之中的福祉；
于是我的心便涨满幸福，
和水仙一同翩翩起舞。
